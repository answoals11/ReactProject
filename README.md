This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

# This file is designed to practice css and animation design.

I copied the Starbucks design and you can learn animation code with my code.

## File Info

This project is largely divided into components folder and container folder, And I used the structure of spa.
Export at once to index.js files to reduce file complexity and make it easy to see.

### `components Folder`

This folder is divided into four folders again.

#### `Footer`

I have created the bottom part of the web page.
The school and copyright of the person who created the web page are written here.

#### `Header`

I have created the top part of the web page.
Here I have created a menu bar, and you can access the folders in the container folder.

#### `LoginForm`

I have created a login form for a web page.
The login form source was extracted from Google and used.

#### `Main`

This is the first screen you see when you run it.
Files with animation effects.

### `Container Folder`

This folder is divided into six folders again.

#### `Coffee Container`

This is the screen that comes out when you press the coffee in the menu bar. The coffee menu appears.

#### `Dessert Container`

This is the screen that comes out when you click on the dessert in the menu bar. The type of dessert appears.

#### `Drink Container`

This is the screen that comes out when you press the drink in the menu bar. The type of drink appears.

#### `Main Container`

This is the screen that comes out when you press the logo on the menu bar. I filled out the contents that will go into the main page.

#### `Order Container`

This is the screen that comes out when you click Order on the menu bar. I added a search bar and all kinds of menus.

#### `Tea Container`

This is the screen that comes out when you press the tee on the menu bar. The menus on the tee appear.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
